### Exercise 1.3: Define a procedure that takes three numbers  as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two  larger numbers.

```lisp
(define (highsquare a b c)
	(cond (and (< a b) (< a c)) (sum-of-square b c)
		  (and (< b a) (< b c)) (sum-of-square a c)
		  (else (sum-of-square b c))))
(define (sum-of-square a b)
	(+ (square a) (square b)))
	```
