applicative-order evaluation:
(test 0 (p))
(test 0 (p))
(test 0 (p))
it will never terminates because p evaluate to p, which will be run first in applicative-order

normal-order evaluation:
(test 0 (p))
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
0
In normal-order, because (p) is not used, the procedure will ignore it and the result is 0
