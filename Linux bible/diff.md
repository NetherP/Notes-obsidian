-   At the very basic of it's use, this command compares the character byte-by-byte and tries to find what is the difference between 2 files. Though this can ONLY compare 2 files at a time. Wanna learn more about this command, checkout resources.
-   There is also another command known as `comm`. This command compares 2 sorted files line by line. As diff tries to find any difference between the files, comm is more focused to find out what is common in between 2 files. Checkout resources to learn more.
